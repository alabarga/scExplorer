--For Data registration: 
The following items are mandatory.
study: The name of the study, which should include all the samples as a collection. 
species: Human, Mouse, etc
tissue: The biological source of the samples (blood, inflamed, uninvolved etc). 
mapType:  Currently, we support tsne, umap, and phate.
name: The map name used in the GUI.  

The following information is optional, but we encourage you to use.
disease: This help to create a collected atlas of normal tissue or disease tissue.
source: You can use internal or external to distinguish the data source.
author: This indicate the contact person of the data or author who created the map in single cell explorer. 
subjectid: Subject ID, which represent the each donor in the study, should be unique. Sometime, there are multiple tissue samples could be collected from the same individual or subject ID. 
  
Usage:
For a study that collect blood, uninvolved, and involved samples from multiple subjects. We can create the following dictionary. You can also add more meta information in the dictionary.    

mapinfo={       
          “study”:”Disease Collection”,
          “species”: “Homo sapien”,
          “tissue”: “involved”,
          “mapType”:”tsne”,
          “name”:”involved sample”, 
          “source”:”public data”,
          “author”:”Me”,
          “subjectid”:”CT0001”,
          “comment”:””       
         }

--Multiple Sample Comparison
Once you registered all the samples from a study. You can cross-compare gene expression among multiple donor/subjects within that study.  You can select 1) the study 2) the right tissue to compare, 3) the cell type 4) the gene of interest for comparison.
